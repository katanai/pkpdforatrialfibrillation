Case Study :  Personalized anti-coagulation: optimizing warfarin management using genetics and simulated clinical trials (Ravvaz et al)

I. Introduction and problem description

There are conflicting results with clinical trials testing pharmacometric-guided warfarin therapies for patients with atrial fibrillation.
Patient safety is at stake when warfarin is not prescribed appropriately.

Warfarin, an oral drug caters to the condition of atrial fibrillation, is prescribed in such a type of anticoagulant medication that 
helps prevent clots fro forming in the blood. It relies heavily on the genetic markup and other biomarkers for an optimal drug dosing recommendation.
Given tht the genetic markup of each individual is fairly unique, this proposed a unique challenge for the medical community to develop
a standard prescription recommendation across diverse populations. 
It is also time-consuming and perhaps difficult to implement, on a whole healthcare sphere that is, personalized one-to-one sequential diagnosing.
This opens a unique opportunity for an exploration of whether precision medicine of "Subpopulatin" can balance the need for personalized prescription 
on an individual level vs. standardization of gene-reliant drug prescription on a bigger spectrum.
